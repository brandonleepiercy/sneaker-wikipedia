## Description

This repository contains a set of files used to create 'Icebox', an online sneaker encyclopedia. Shoes are a massive market and the reseller's market for limited edition shoes is flush with cash. Certain pairs get listed for well over $10,000 a pair, and thousands of pairs of limited edition shoes change ownership each day. Despite this, there is no good 'encyclopedia' for sneakers. Icebox acts as a searchable index of everything you could possibly want to know about a specific sneaker. Icebox stores information about the collaborators, the release date, the production size range and the current price range for prospective buyers. On the search page, users can filter results by brand, collaborators, sizes, and more. This app is powered by javascript, express, and mysql.

## Installation

Type "npm i" into CMD to install the neccesary packages for this repository.

## Usage

Searching for a specific shoe, and reading about the information related to the sneaker. Future releases intend to provide information so that the user can convert sizes to the other gender's size, so that the user may purchase shoes intended for the opposite gender, if sizes in their gender are sold out or otherwise unavailable. Future releases also intend to provide links to active listings/ places where these shoes can be purchased, given that they are typically not listed on manufacturer sites.
